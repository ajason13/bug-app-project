# Bug Log

*Register bugs into the system. The application should first ask how many bugs should be entered into the system. Then the system should perform a loop asking for all bug details storing them into individual arrays, including:
bugId (int), reporterName, bugName, bugCategory(char), operatingSystem, date, bugDetails, frequency (double), isActive (boolean). Finally the system should display all bugs and details before exiting.
